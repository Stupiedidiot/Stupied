                    <p>A senior highschool student who's 3 years younger than her class. Ever since her mother killed herself, she has been living under the care of her aunt. Lately she's been struggling to keep up with her classmates and copes by writting in a diary.</p>

                    <h3>Diane Dobrik</h3>
                    <p>Isn't in speaking terms with her sister, partly because she hated her but mostly because she's currently dead. She never intended to have a child but loves Ashley to death.</p>
