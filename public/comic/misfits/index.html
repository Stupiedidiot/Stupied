                <p>The leader of The Misfits Rescue Team. Not much is know from her past since she tends to keep to herself. She won't admit it but she cares a lot about the team and often worries about letting them down.</p>

                <h2>Maudie</h2><hr>
                <p>Princess who ran away in hopes to discover beauty and wonder. Suddenly life in the palace is no longer as comfortable, knowing the difficult life the citizens have. She asked Cheeze if she wanted to form a rescue team, offering to be the one carrying items and providing meals. She's a bit niave and often confused but her nanny has taught her to always be open minded.</p>

                <p>Cheeze's right hand man. She scans locations, prepares remedies, and annoys the hell out of Cheeze. She's clingy and lovesick but she gets the job done. She was abandoned at a young age due to an extreme tradition among Starleys. She cannot attack normally and heavily relies on seeds instead.</p>
