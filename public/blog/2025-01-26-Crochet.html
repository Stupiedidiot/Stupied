        <p>Although I started crocheting during Odette, I haven't finished that many projects. I think I did like 4 things with only 2 of them still being around. The number of projects I've <i>started</i> though... Is an entirely different matter.</p>

        <p>Very often I would fall in love with an idea and impulsively jump into it. When I get halfway through a project I would discover flaws I failed to consider then get discouraged. I'd put it off until eventually I stop working on it. This blog post is dedicated to progress updates of old projects I intend to finish! I'll try to explain why I didn't like them and what I've learned from em. Before that here is a list of the stuff I'll be finishing:</p>
