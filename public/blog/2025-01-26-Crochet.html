        <p><span id="pageDesc">Although I started crocheting during Odette, I haven't finished that many projects.</span> I think I did like 4 things with only 2 of them still being around. The number of projects I've <i>started</i> though... Is an entirely different matter.</p>

        <p>Very often I would fall in love with an idea and impulsively jump into it. When I get halfway through a project I would discover flaws I failed to consider then get discouraged. I'd put it off until eventually I stop working on it. This blog post is dedicated to progress updates of old projects I intend to finish! I'll try to explain why I didn't like them and what I've learned from em. Before that here is a list of the stuff I'll be finishing:</p>

                <h3>Tetris Blanket</h3>
                <div>

                    <p>For a bit of context I didn't choose the colors of yarn I have. Almost all my yarn is from my mom's sister's uncle's aunt, who didn't want them anymore. So my mom's sister's uncle's aunt gives it to aforementioned uncle, who offers to sell it to my mom's sister. Since she wasn't interested she brought up the offer to my mom, who accepted it and got this big plastic bag filled with an assortment of yarn for around 2k pesos?? It's been a while so the details are a bit fuzzy.</p>

                    <p>Looking for a reason to use it all up I decided a blanket would be a fun project. I had no prior experience of making granny squares but I thought it would be simple. Part of the reason I felt demotivated to finish this one is because of how inconsistent the sizes of the squares are. I figured the blanket would be all wobbly once I'd stitch them together. Another problem is the kind of granny square I choose eats up a ton of yarn and I estimated that the blanket I was gonna make would be too small for my liking.</p>

                    <p>With all those problems set aside. I think a wobbly finished blanket is better than random granny squares scattered about my boxes.</p>
