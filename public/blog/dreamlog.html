    <p>Down the cliff was quaint enclosed lake. I was waiting for my friends to arrive. Eventually we changed our mind and decided to meet up at the mall instead. I waited at the parking lot inside a red pick-up truck. When the two of them arrived we all sat in the truck’s long front bench seat. We we’re gossiping about people we didn’t like.</p>

    <p>My dad dropped me off his workplace when I saw my friend across the street. I walked over to him, then we talked about what we were planning take for collage which slowly turned into a super #deep philosophical conversation about the meaninglessness of life. There was this guy with comically large backpack sneaking behind the 2 of us. The stranger asked to talk with me alone, I agreed despite how unnervingly touchy he was. He kept caressing my face, mumbling a question I couldn’t understand. I eventually screamed for help and tried to run back to my dad’s workplace. The building was unfortunately closed off, so I just kept running away. </p>
    <p>My friend called up his biker gang who helped block the stranger’s way and some female officers started tailing me, offering to help. The girl scouts carrying bamboo sticks lead us to a desolated landfill.  As I sit down on the woven coconut mat the girl scouts provided me, I started to feel guilty and thought I overacted. Some male officers came by and asked to see the Nokia phone that had the secret code and allowed me to leave.</p>
    <p>When I got back to the spot, neither my friend nor the stranger was there. Instead, a portrait Joe Biden was yelling at me, telling me to leave. I turned to another street and found myself in a small empty enclosed park where Benson from The Regular Show was fuming. Apparently, he instructed Muscle Man and High Five Ghost to destroy the building besides the park since it belongs to a company he hated. Turns out the building wasn’t even real and was just a cardboard cutout.</p>

    <p>Since they we’re planning to restart the Minecraft server I was allowed to be in creative mode. I roamed around the caves and found what I assumed to be a warden retextured to be a skeleton. Inconveniently, I was switched back into survival mode where I eventually got killed by the warden.</p>
    <p>I’ve had enough Minecraft for that day, so I closed my laptop and went out the classroom. I was approached by some junior high student who we’re selling bottled juice for a school project. I promised I would get some after I get some change downstairs. When I went back up, they reformed 2 entire classrooms to be a convenient store with a pool on the side.</p> 
    <p>I picked up bottles of calamansi, apple, lemon, and chocolate milk. When I asked how much all of it would cause they said they weren’t sure yet. I decided to leave them along and dipped my feet it the pool while sipping on my calamansi juice. I went back to them and asked again but they still didn’t have an answer. I got impatient and gave them 40 pesos for the calamansi I drank and told them I didn’t want to buy the rest. I stormed off only to return to take 10 pesos back, realizing I paid to much for such a small bottle.</p>

    <h4>June 14, 2024</h4>
    <p>Passing through the narrow red school hallways, I was being tailed by 2 students. One was an overweight transman while the other was a typical skinny nerd with glasses. They we’re throwing stuff at me and insulting me. Upset, I told them what they we’re doing was bullying and could constitute as a hate crime. In retrospect, I was overacting and the teacher who overheard it was thinking the same. She got upset at me and brought all three of us to the principal’s office.</p>
    <p> The office was a nice combination of blues and white. The room was stuffy despite being able to hear the electric fan. The transman told the principal how hurt he was of the arguments I made during the class debate yesterday, which I assume is something about the effects of becoming trans, and he used it for justification of treating me poorly. I tried to reason that I was just doing what I needed to do during the debate and that the things I’ve said do not accurately reflect my personal views. Even if it did, I said it was still not an adequate reason to be an asshole. No ideology is perfect, and people deserve an opportunity to voice out their concerns especially ones made in good faith.</p>
    <p>The principal was very understanding and let us all off. When everyone else had left, I had to go back to the back of room to get my stuff, but I guess the teacher that brought me there didn’t realize I was still there. She slowly morphed into some red demon-like creature. She was so skinny her ribcage visible, and her torso was unnaturally long. She was going off some Disney-esque monologue about wanting me gone or something.</p>

<h4>April 30, 2024</h4>
<p>It was the day before exam. Since I was getting complacent, I didn't bother studying. I woke up early and went to this gigantic closed off church. It had greek-esque architecture with an eerie lighting. There were pop up shops and a big stage.</p>
<p>I went to a cosmetic booth and began looking for Pokémon cards. One box was hidden away in the corner. I excitedly open it and took a quick glance at the first card, it looked legit at the time, so I stuffed it into a bag I was carrying and paid for it. I went around looking for more but eventually I got sidetracked and met up with my friends behind the big stage.</p>
<p>There were currently multiple female dancers wearing long white dresses on stage. Some of them we're wearing creepy weaved masks. The eye holes had some red paint around it. The performance is, I assumed to be, an important traditional dance.</p>
<p>One of my friends told me they felt bad because one of the dancers they were aquatinted with was supposed to perform without the mask on, but an accident happened.</p>
<p>I bring out the cards out of the bag to show it off to them but I as I was flipping through the cards, I had the unfortunate of finding out they were not legit Pokémon cards. In fact, they were not even based on Pokémon at all and had weird uncanny photoshop stock images. I felt like such a fool for not double checking.</p>

<h4>April 19, 2024</h4>
<p>I rushed up to the school's roof top, where our class was being held. Once I got there, they told me I go to the gym to participate in some group art contest. When I got there everyone else was really busy and I wasn't sure how to help. I just stood there looking like a moron.</p>

<h4>April 18, 2024</h4>
<p>We were at my grandma's house eating food served my someone who is most definitely not my grandma. The vibe was really awkward especially since my younger sister nonchalantly said something my older sister did not like. My older sister was visibly getting annoyed as my younger sister began justifying the reason why she said it. After dinner I turned around and my mom was setting up those slides you'd see in a pool, except it was a "portable" one and was those compressible tubes thingies. Me and my younger sibling slide down it a few times then I told them I had to go to an interview.</p>
<p>I went out to the garden and saw a 40-ish year-old woman. Her dyed blond hair was clipped on as an upward ponytail. We talked about what I wanted to be in the future, which ultimately lead to nowhere, so she started recommending me random professions.</p>

<h4>April 8, 2024</h4>
<p>It was midnight and just before I went to sleep my mom gave me a laptop for my birthday. Despite being new the laptop had an 2000s-esque design. It was metallic grey and had a bezel that ate up most of the screen. The keyboard had compressed vertical keys and the touchpad was hallow. Fairly certain there was even a sticker at the bottom left that stated it only had 3gb of ram.</p>

<p>Regardless, the prospect of setting it up got me too excited to fall asleep. I booted it up and oddly enough my files from my previous laptop were already in there.</p>

<p>I was working on my crochet Tetris blanket when I got impatient and decided to start stitching my granny squares together. For some reason I wasn't following the pattern I intially planned out. Instead I arranged each row with a checkered rainbow pattern.</p>

<p>While I was doing this my older sister was there. We were having a lighthearted and fun conversation. It was in that moment I realized I was dreaming.</p>

<h4>April 04, 2024</h4>
<p>I was showing my sketchbook off to some classmates. For some reason majority of the artwork weren't mine or, at the very least, I wasn't sure if they were. It was kinda awkward trying to that explain that to them.</p>
<p>After awhile I open up an art thread from an anonymous site, which was in Spanish, so that I could draw out someone's ocs. One of my classmates remarked at how sweet of me to do that, but then I flat out told them I was just doing it to poke fun of their oc.</p>
<p>On the next day and I arrived back to school, all my classmates were gathered outside. They were making a camp fire to cook food. I think we're starting a party so we wouldn't have to do the reporting today.</p>
