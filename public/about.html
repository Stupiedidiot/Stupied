                <p>I'm a wannabe artist who thinks they're cooler than what they actually are. I draw and write awful comics and program a bit.</p>
                
                <p>I'm extremely impulsive, so please don't expect any consistency from me.</p>

            <hr>
            <h1>>What's in the name?</h1>
            <p>Pronounced as it's sounds (ˈstü-'pīd), my pen name dates back to my elementary years. I consider myself quite literate but I lack skills in spelling. I found it funny that no one ever bothered correcting the way I spelled stupid up until grade 6. So I decided to proudly wear this mistake lol.</p>


            <h1>>Where can I learn about your ocs?</h1>
            <p>I have an unhealthy amount of ocs. I've developed a fear of sharing about them, for reason that are too lengthy to explain here. I will make comics about them soon, I promise. xD</p>


            <h1>>What are your inspirations?</h1>
            <p>When it comes to my art specifically: <a href="https://literalhat.com/" target="_blank">Literal hat</a>, <a href="https://linktr.ee/sevenchiart" target="_blank">Sevenchiart</a>, <a href="https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCD4XIm3ZFhT72WjqhIXMN9w&ved=2ahUKEwjD1YXjlrT_AhWW8DgGHZZACOwQFnoECAkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3t_heI4_JaJqKk6-5WVG6W" target="_blank">LavenderTowne</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/carles_dalmau/" target="_blank">Carles Dalmau</a> comes to mind. I am inspired by a lot of things and it's difficult to pin point them all!</p>

            <h1>>Do you do commissions?</h1>
            <p>I've done quite a hefty amount of them, but the paranoia never seems to go away. I tend to stress about whether or not my art is worth the price I give it. Feel free to personally ask me, but know that there is no guarantee. <a href="./art/commissions.html">Click for more details</a></p>
