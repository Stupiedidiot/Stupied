                <p>Every once a while I get those comments asking me about my art and how I go about making it. I usually put off responding to it till I eventually forget about them. This page is dedicated for that, so I don't have to answer individually. <span class="txt-darker-pink">I'll expand more on these in the future (maybe).</span></p>

                <p>I don't really use anything fancy and you don't have to either. Just continue using whatever you're comfortable with and/or is accessible to you. No point in getting expensive materials if you don't put them to use.</p>

            <h2 id="C">How do you choose your colors?</h2>
            <p>Ignore hue and focus on contrast. Use saturation to drag a viewers eye to specific places. Look at other people's drawings and analyze the relationship between colors relative to the piece as a whole.</p>
            
            <p>Aside from that I genuinely don't know what I'm doing. I just put random bullshit and hope it works. Good luck!</p>
